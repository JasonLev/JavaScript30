    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    people[2] = "Tim"
    console.log(players);
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()
    team2[1] = "Adam"
    console.log(team2, players);
    // one way
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5[1] = "Stephen"
    console.log(team5, players);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    team3[1] = "Eve"
    console.log(team3, players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    team4[1] = "Joey"
    console.log(team4, players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const president = person
    president.age = 22
    console.log(person, president);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const admiral = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 44})
    console.log(person, admiral);
    // We have the object ...spread
    const ranger = {...person }
    ranger.age = 89
    console.log(person, ranger);
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const titan = {
      age: 432,
      name: 'Titus',
      jobs: {
        day: 'being strong',
        night: 'sleeping'
      }
    }
    // copy the titan:
    const titan2 = Object.assign({}, titan, {nickname: "strong man"})
    console.log(titan, titan2);
    titan2.jobs.day = "helping the world"
    console.log(titan, titan2);
    // making it a string and back to an object is a hacking way to do it:
    const titan3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(titan))
